# Habit Logger Console Aplication
_________
This a C# Console Application designed to store and track habits on a very basic level.
This application makes use of Sqlite and CRUD operations. 

## Requirements
- [ ] This is an application where you’ll register one habit.
- [ ] This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)
- [ ] The application should store and retrieve data from a real database
- [ ] When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- [ ] It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
- [ ] The app should show the user a menu of options.
- [ ] The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- [ ] You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- [ ] The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
- [ ] You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
- [x] Your project needs to contain a Read Me file.

## Challenges
- Let the users create their own habits to track. That will require that you let them choose the unit of measurement of each habit.
- Create a report functionality where the users can view specific information (i.e. how many times the user ran in a year? how many kms?) SQL allows you to ask very interesting things from your database.
